Project Description:
Rajasthan is known for its heritage,culture and tourism. We aim to bring all these together while paving a path for upliftment of its women, poor artisans and craftsmen. Ours is the most awesome solution because through this we are solving multiple issues together. We are developing a platform where tourists would be able to locate nearby small rural businesses (like carving, weaving, pottery etc) and would have a chance to have first hand experience of being introduced to their culture and their life. Our primary purpose is to provide an alternative (VIKALP) to the women of the state in rural, tribal and urban slum belts. This would make women self-dependent, more skilled and would let them have a respectable position in their family and society and it would help to thrive tourism at the same time.
